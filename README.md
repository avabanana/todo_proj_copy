# PomoTracker
PomoTracker is a productivity app to help people, especially students, get things done on time and stay on top of their tasks. It includes a timer, to-do list, and a motivational animated bunny.

In today’s world, people are often overwhelmed with the amount of work they have to complete, and it doesn’t help that social media and phones are there to muck up any attempts at time management, causing stress and anxiety (we would know).
Pomotracker is an app that provides a pomodoro timer (25 minutes of studying, 5 minute breaks), where students will not only develop good time management, but will begin to see studying and working as something more than a chore. 

## Process
We ideated and designed our app together (color scheme, wireframe). We used Xcode and Swift to code our app. We all started off in Content View decided the basic layout of our view before branching out into other files. Then, we began working on our individually designated parts of the app.
- timer & buttons:
  - pomodoro countdown timer (25 min & 5 min break)
  - buttons:
    - pause/start
    - reset
    - skip
  - “ding~” alarm when timer is done
- to-do list
  - space to add, edit, and check off tasks (delete task)
- motivational animated bunny
  - will leave a motivational message if you work for longer than a minute 
  - takes breaks with you

## Challenges & Accomplishments
- resolving merge conflicts was  p a i n f u l (mostly bc everything was in the same view)
- reworking the to-do list (List → Grid, class → struct)
- making the background of the bunny something that worked with the color scheme
  
- adding a lil “ding~” for an alarm (it’s so satisfying to hear!)
- finishing a functional app!
